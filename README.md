### Hi there,i am NasibðŸ‘‹

I am an Android Developer and student at Baku Engineering University studying bachelor's degree.
I've started with frontend development first and then switched into android development which i love a lot.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the e-commerce app just for practicing things like Dagger2,MVVM and some other things i learned lately
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning android development with Kotlin language(I feel it will become one of favourite languages :) )
- âš¡ Interesting fact: I love playing and watching football, so i am really looking into merging coding and this hobby to create something new
